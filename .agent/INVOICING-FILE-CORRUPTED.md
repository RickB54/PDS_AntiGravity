# 🚨 INVOICING FILE CORRUPTED - NEEDS RESTORE

## What Happened:

The `src/pages/Invoicing.tsx` file got corrupted during my edits. It has:
- Duplicate content
- Unclosed tags
- Mixed-up sections

## Current Errors:

- Multiple JSX elements without closing tags
- Content appears 2-3 times
- File won't compile

## How To Fix:

### Option 1: Git Revert (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- src/pages/Invoicing.tsx
```

This will restore the last committed version.

### Option 2: Manual Restore

I can help rebuild the file if you don't have a git version, but it would be better to revert!

2. ⏳ Move Estimates to separate page  

## Sorry, My Friend!

I made a mistake during the file edits. The replacement got confused and added duplicate content.

**Best next step**: Revert the file with git, then I'll make smaller, safer changes!

Let me know if you want to:
- A) Revert with git (recommended)  
- B) Try to manually fix it with me

I'm really sorry about this! 😔
