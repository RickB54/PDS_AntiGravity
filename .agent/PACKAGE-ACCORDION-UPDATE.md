# ✅ Package Comparison Guide Updated

## Accordion Implementation
- **Comparison Summary**: Wrapped in an Accordion, defaults to **OPEN**.
- **Package Explanations**: Wrapped in an Accordion, defaults to **OPEN**.
- **Actual Packages**: Wrapped in an Accordion, defaults to **CLOSED**.
- **Other Packages**: Wrapped in an Accordion, defaults to **CLOSED**.

The layout is now cleaner and allows users to focus on the comparison results initially, expanding the package lists only when needed.
